                <h4>Smart Irrigation System With Arduino</h4>
                <p>
                    In an automatic plant watering system or we can say it smart irrigation system. we are using an
                    Arduino microcontroller to control and sense the thing in the projects such as sense or measure the
                    moisture in the soil we are using soil moisture sensor. the soil moisture sensor is a sensor which
                    varies the value when it contacts the moisture. basically it is a resistor that works on moisture
                    condition. when the moisture is more then the value of resistance will decrease and when the
                    moisture is less then the resistance value is more.

                <h4>Data Analysis Using Pandas Library with Python</h4>
                <p>
                    This project demonstrates pandas library python how to import a dataset from the source and
                    implement the function which is used in this project. multiple functions to be drawn in this
                    implementation

                <h4>Real time Face mask Detection & Object Detection Uisng Tensorflow, OpenCV library with Python </h4>
                <p>
                    Face mask detection refers to detect whether a person is wearing a mask or not. In fact, the problem
                    is reverse engineering of face detection where the face is detected using different machine learning
                    algorithms for the purpose of security, authentication and surveillance.

            <h4>Smart Irrigation System Using Arduino Technical Report</h4>
            <p>
                This report presents a novel approach towards effective irrigation system. The prepared system comprised
                of an Arduino, moisture sensors, submersible water pump, and relay mechanism. The two moisture sensors
                sense the condition of dryness of soil at two different places on the field feed the signal to Arduino
                system will take the inputs from both the sensors and based on that it will decide how much water should
                be supplied. This system will continue to take the inputs from the sensors until there is sufficient
                amount of moisture in the soil and then it will automatically turn the pump off. This irrigation system
                will reduce the hardship of farmers, save the time and enhance accuracy and effectiveness in relatively
                minimal cost. Watering is the most important cultural practice and most labor intensive task in daily
                greenhouse operation. Watering systems ease the burden of getting water to plants when they need it.
                Knowing when and how much to water is two important aspects of watering process. To make the gardener
                works easily, the automatic plant watering system is created. There have a various type using automatic
                watering system that are by using sprinkler system, tube, nozzles and other. This system uses Arduino
                UNO board, which consists of ATmega328 microcontroller. It is programmed in such a way that it will
                sense the moisture level of the plants and supply the water if required. This type of system is often
                used for general plant care, as part of caring for small and large gardens. Normally, the plants need to
                be watered twice daily, morning and evening. So, the microcontroller has to be coded to water the plants
                in the greenhouse about two times per day. However for most people it becomes challenging to keep them
                healthy and alive. This system automation is designed to be assistive for the University Park. This
                system hopes that through this prototype people will enjoy having plants without the challenges related
                to absent or forgetfulness
